# Assignment code
This is a collection of noteworthy assignments from different classes I took at BVU. It is primarily meant to be examples of past experience with other languages. I will likely remove these once I have more serious code in some side projects made in various languages. Most of these assignments are copies of what I submitted so keep in mind that these were made with time constraint, having to juggle other classes, and with varying levels of skill (since these assignments range from first year of BVU to my last). So bugs, formatting issues, and inefficiencies are likely present. I ommited assignment or project that involved groups or partners so everything present is made by me alone. If you want to see code more representative of what I can do now please check out my senior capstone: https://github.com/torgvad/Retailer-Assistant-Dev-Version.
