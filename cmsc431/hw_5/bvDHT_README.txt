The file will need to be in the same directory as a folder called "repository" and a folder called "storing", 
though these should be made by the program itself.

Any file that a user wants to insert into the DHT must be in the "repository" folder.
All files inserted that the user owns the keyspace to go in the "storing" folder.
Any files that a user "gets" go in the "repository" folder with their hash as the name.
At this point the file can simply be run with "python3 bvDHT.py" all the inputs the program will need is handled in the program itself.
